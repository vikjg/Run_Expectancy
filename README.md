# Run_Expectancy

A quick weekend project to calculate the RE24 matrix, RE288 matrix, and wOBA to RE regressions. Calculated run expectancy matrices for 2023, player specific and wOBA specific matrices for '21 to '23. 

Was able to produce some interesting regression results that predicted an RE matrix accurately for any given wOBA.

As a quick project, tons of oversights: All run environments are assumed equal, no consideration for team wOBA and an assumption that players' 2023 wOBA was their true talent, and these calculations are seriously inefficient.
To make these feasible for future use, pipelines and functions need built, optimization needs to occur, and less assumptions regarding a constant game need to be made.
